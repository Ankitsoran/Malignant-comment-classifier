Due the penetration of the internet in all domains of life which has led to increase of peopleâ€™s participation actively
and give remarks as an issue of communicating their concern/feedback/opinion in various online forums. Although
most of the times these comments are helpful for the creator toextemporize the substance that is being provided to
people, but sometimes these may be abusive and create hatred-feeling among the people. Thus as these are openly
available to the public which is being viewed from various sections of the society, people in different age groups,
different communities and different socio-economic background, it becomes the prime responsibility of the
